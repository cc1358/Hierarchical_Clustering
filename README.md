This project demonstrates the implementation and exploration of hierarchical clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique. The script uses Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-learn to generate sample data, perform clustering with different linkage methods, visualize results through scatter plots and dendrograms, and discuss advanced topics like inversion, practical applications, and limitations.

The project is designed as an educational tool to understand how hierarchical clustering works, compare linkage criteria, and explore its real-world applications and challenge
